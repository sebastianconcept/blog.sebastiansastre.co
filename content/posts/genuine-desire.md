In the vast landscape of business, one truth remains immutable: you can't negotiate genuine desire. It's a lesson that traditional industries have tried to bend to their will, and even in the dynamic world of startups and tech products, it's a concept that refuses to yield.

Consider, for a moment, the conventional approach to business. Picture a car dealership with a pushy salesperson who insists that their shiny sedan is exactly what you need. You may relent and make the purchase, but your heart doesn't truly desire that vehicle. Sure, it serves a purpose, but it doesn't inspire genuine passion

Now, imagine walking into an upscale fashion boutique. The well-designed storefront and carefully curated displays invite you to explore. No one pressures you to buy, but you find yourself irresistibly drawn to a stunning dress. It's not because someone coerced you; it's because the product spoke to your imagination using it, your sense of style and your possible expressions when using it. That's genuine desire in action.

For startups and tech products, the same principle applies. Let's say you've developed an innovative mobile app, but your initial marketing strategy revolves around intrusive pop-up ads and persistent notifications. You may see a temporary surge in downloads, but are these users genuinely desiring your app? More often than not, they're merely capitulating to persistent marketing tactics. What do you think the churn would be?

On the other hand, consider the story of a small tech startup that created a x10 solution as an app. Instead of bombarding potential users with ads, they offered a series of well-crafted blog posts and videos explaining how their app could transform daily life. It will help its users to get specific jobs done. They nurtured a community of early adopters, actively engaging with feedback and suggestions. Soon, users weren't just downloading the app; they were enthusiastically sharing it with friends. Why? Because the app genuinely resonated with their needs and desires.

Something that is key for a successful product is creating content that provokes attractiveness. It works on seduction rather than pushing an outcome. You cannot negotiate desire because desire happens inside your audience, not you.

Are you listening to your audience? Can you express their needs in better terms than they do?\n\nCan you craft the narratives that resonate emotionally with them?

What do you stand for? Is that desirable for them?

You don't have control over the audience needs and desires.

Good news is that you do have control over designing environments where remarkable solutions can be experienced and curiosity can be awaken.

And that's how it starts.
